 * @brief Namespace for structures that hold data at a single quadrature point
 *
 * This namespace contains various structures and functions that are used to
 * hold and manipulate data at a single quadrature point in the context of
 * finite element methods. It includes data structures for properties, fields,
 * kernels, and other related entities that are essential for numerical
 * simulations in geophysics and other fields.
