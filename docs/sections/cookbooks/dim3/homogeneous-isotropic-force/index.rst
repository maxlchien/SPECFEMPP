.. _homogeneous_halfspace_3d_example:

Wave propagation through 3D homogeneous media
==============================================

In this example we simulate wave propagation through a 3-dimensional homogeneous halfspace using a force source.

Setting up your workspace
--------------------------

Let's start by creating a workspace from where we can run this example.

.. code-block:: bash

    mkdir -p ~/specfempp-examples/homogeneous-halfspace-single-force
    cd ~/specfempp-examples/homogeneous-halfspace-single-force

We also need to check that the SPECFEM++ executable directory is added to the
``PATH``.

.. code:: bash

    which specfem3d

If the above command returns a path to the ``specfem3d`` executable, then the
executable directory is added to the ``PATH``. If not, you need to add the executable
directory to the ``PATH`` using the following command.

.. code:: bash

    export PATH=$PATH:<PATH TO SPECFEM++ DIRECTORY/bin>

.. note::

    Make sure to replace ``<PATH TO SPECFEM++ DIRECTORY/bin>`` with the
    actual path to the SPECFEM++ directory on your system.

Now let's create the necessary directories to store the input files and output
artifacts.

.. code:: bash

    mkdir -p OUTPUT_FILES
    mkdir -p OUTPUT_FILES/results
    mkdir -p OUTPUT_FILES/DATABASES
    mkdir -p DATA
    mkdir -p DATA/meshfem3D_files

    touch specfem_config.yaml
    touch force.yaml

Generating a mesh
-----------------

To generate the mesh for the homogeneous halfspace we need a mesh parameter file,
``Mesh_Par_file``, interface files (``interfaces.txt`` and ``interface1.txt``),
and the mesher executable, ``xmeshfem3D``, which should have been compiled during
the installation process.

.. note::
  The 3D mesher is based on the mesher developed for `SPECFEM3D Cartesian <https://specfem3d.readthedocs.io/>`_.
  More details on the meshing process can be found in the SPECFEM3D Cartesian documentation.

We first define the meshing parameters in a Mesh Parameter file.

Mesh Parameter File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. literalinclude:: DATA/meshfem3D_files/Mesh_Par_file
    :caption: Mesh_Par_file
    :language: bash
    :emphasize-lines: 10-14,20,33-34,70,90,97,106,109

At this point, it is worthwhile to note a few key parameters within the
``Mesh_Par_file`` as it pertains to SPECFEM++.

- This version of SPECFEM++ does not support simulations running across multiple
  cores/nodes, i.e., we have not enabled MPI. Relevant parameter values:

  .. literalinclude:: DATA/meshfem3D_files/Mesh_Par_file
      :language: bash
      :linenos:
      :start-at: NPROC_XI
      :end-at: NPROC_ETA
      :lineno-match:

- The mesh domain is defined by the coordinates and depth. In this case we define
  a domain that is 100km x 80km x 60km. Relevant parameter values:

  .. literalinclude:: DATA/meshfem3D_files/Mesh_Par_file
      :language: bash
      :linenos:
      :start-at: LATITUDE_MIN
      :end-at: SUPPRESS_UTM_PROJECTION
      :lineno-match:

- The number of elements along the XI and ETA directions define the horizontal
  resolution of the mesh:

  .. literalinclude:: DATA/meshfem3D_files/Mesh_Par_file
      :language: bash
      :linenos:
      :start-at: NEX_XI
      :end-at: NEX_ETA
      :lineno-match:

- The path to the interfaces file is provided using the ``INTERFACES_FILE``
  parameter:

  .. literalinclude:: DATA/meshfem3D_files/Mesh_Par_file
      :language: bash
      :linenos:
      :start-at: INTERFACES_FILE
      :end-at: INTERFACES_FILE
      :lineno-match:

- We define a single homogeneous material with density 2300 kg/m³, Vp = 2800 m/s,
  and Vs = 1500 m/s. The domain type is set to 2 (elastic):

  .. literalinclude:: DATA/meshfem3D_files/Mesh_Par_file
      :language: bash
      :linenos:
      :start-at: NMATERIALS
      :end-at: 1   2300.0   2800.0   1500.0  0 0 0 2
      :lineno-match:

- We define a single region that spans the entire mesh and assigns material 1 to it:

  .. literalinclude:: DATA/meshfem3D_files/Mesh_Par_file
      :language: bash
      :linenos:
      :start-at: NREGIONS
      :end-at: 1              15           1               12            1         9        1
      :lineno-match:

Interfaces file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The interfaces file defines the topography and layer structure of the mesh.

.. literalinclude:: DATA/meshfem3D_files/interfaces.txt
    :caption: interfaces.txt
    :language: bash
    :emphasize-lines: 10-11,16

The interfaces file describes:

- The number of interfaces (in this case, 1 - the top surface)
- For each interface: whether it's defined by a file (`.true.`), the number of
  points along XI and ETA directions, the starting coordinates (0.0, 0.0),
  and spacing (1000.0, 1000.0)
- The path to the interface data file
- The number of spectral elements in the vertical direction for each layer (9 elements)

Interface data file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The interface data file contains the elevation values at the grid points:

.. literalinclude:: DATA/meshfem3D_files/interface1.txt
    :caption: interface1.txt
    :language: bash

In this case, all elevation values are 0, meaning we have a flat top surface.

Running ``xmeshfem3D``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To execute the mesher run:

.. code:: bash

    xmeshfem3D -p DATA/meshfem3D_files/Mesh_Par_file

Check the mesher generated files in the ``OUTPUT_FILES/DATABASES`` directory:

.. code:: bash

    ls -ltr OUTPUT_FILES/DATABASES

You should see files including:

- ``proc000000_Database.bin`` - the mesh database
- ``proc000000_mesh.vtk`` - mesh visualization file
- ``proc000000_skewness.vtk`` - mesh quality visualization file

Defining receivers (stations)
------------------------------

In 3D simulations, we need to explicitly define the receiver locations using a
STATIONS file.

.. literalinclude:: DATA/STATIONS
    :caption: STATIONS
    :language: bash

Each line defines a station with the format:

``STATION_NAME NETWORK_CODE X Y ELEVATION BURIAL``

where:

- X, Y are the horizontal coordinates in the mesh coordinate system
- ELEVATION is the height above the surface (typically 0.0)
- BURIAL is the depth below the surface (typically 0.0)

In this example, we have 9 stations distributed across the domain.

Defining sources
----------------

Next we define the sources using a YAML file. For a full description of parameters
used to define sources refer to :ref:`source_description`.

.. literalinclude:: force.yaml
    :caption: force.yaml
    :language: yaml
    :emphasize-lines: 3-10,11-14

In this file, we define a single force source with:

- Position: x=51000m, y=43000m, z=-31000m (note: negative z is depth)
- Force components: fx=0, fy=0, fz=1e14 (vertical force)
- Source time function: Ricker wavelet with center frequency 0.15 Hz

Configuring the solver
----------------------

Now that we have generated a mesh and defined the sources and receivers, we need to
set up the solver. We define the configuration in a YAML file ``specfem_config.yaml``.
For a full description of parameters refer to :ref:`parameter_documentation`.

.. literalinclude:: specfem_config.yaml
    :caption: specfem_config.yaml
    :language: yaml
    :emphasize-lines: 3-12,14-31,40-45,53-57

At this point let's focus on a few sections in this file:

- Configure the solver using the ``simulation-setup`` section:

  .. literalinclude:: specfem_config.yaml
      :caption: specfem_config.yaml
      :language: yaml
      :linenos:
      :start-at: simulation-setup
      :end-at: directory: "OUTPUT_FILES/results"
      :lineno-match:

  * We define the integration quadrature to be used in the simulation (``GLL4``)
  * Define the time-stepping scheme (Newmark), time step (0.16s), and number of steps (250)
  * Set the output format for seismograms to ASCII

- Define receiver (station) configuration:

  .. literalinclude:: specfem_config.yaml
      :caption: specfem_config.yaml
      :language: yaml
      :linenos:
      :start-at: receivers:
      :end-at: nstep_between_samples
      :lineno-match:

  * Specify the path to the STATIONS file
  * Set the seismogram type to displacement
  * Set the sampling rate (nstep_between_samples=1 means sample every time step)

- Define the path to the mesh database and source description file:

  .. literalinclude:: specfem_config.yaml
      :caption: specfem_config.yaml
      :language: yaml
      :linenos:
      :start-at: databases:
      :end-at: sources: "force.yaml"
      :lineno-match:

Running the solver
------------------

Finally, to run the SPECFEM++ solver:

.. code:: bash

    specfem3d -p specfem_config.yaml

.. note::

    Make sure either you are in the executable directory of SPECFEM++ or the
    executable directory is added to your ``PATH``.

The solver will output progress information to the terminal and write seismograms
to the ``OUTPUT_FILES/results`` directory.

Visualizing seismograms
-----------------------

Let us now plot the source-station geometry and the traces generated by the solver.
The following Python script reads the ASCII seismogram files and creates two separate
plots:

1. Source-station geometry with distance circles
2. Seismograms for each component (MXX, MXY, MXZ) sorted by epicentral distance

.. literalinclude:: plot_seismograms.py
    :language: python
    :linenos:

To run the plotting script:

.. code:: bash

    python plot_seismograms.py

This will create two plots in the ``OUTPUT_FILES`` directory:

- ``geometry.png`` - showing the source-station geometry
- ``seismograms.png`` - showing the recorded seismograms for all three displacement components

.. figure:: geometry.svg
   :align: center
   :width: 60%

   Source-station geometry. The source is marked by a red star and stations by red
   triangles. Concentric circles indicate epicentral distances in kilometers.

.. figure:: seismograms.svg
   :align: center
   :width: 100%

   Seismograms recorded at stations distributed across the homogeneous halfspace.
   The three panels show displacement components (MXX, MXY, MXZ), with traces
   sorted by epicentral distance from top to bottom.


[Optional] Visualizing the wavefield
------------------------------------

To visualize the wavefield propagation through the homogeneous halfspace, we
have a couple of prerequisites. First, SPECFEM++ must be built with VTK *and*
HDF5 support. Second, Paraview (https://www.paraview.org/) needs to be installed
on your system to visualize the output files. Once these prerequisites are met,
we can uncomment ``display`` section in the ``specfem_config.yaml`` file to
include the following configuration:

.. code:: yaml

    display:
      format: VTKHDF
      directory: OUTPUT_FILES/
      field: displacement
      component: z
      simulation-field: forward
      time-interval: 5

Rerun the solver with the updated configuration. Then open Paraview and load the
generated VTK files from the ``OUTPUT_FILES`` directory to visualize the wavefield
propagation.

.. figure:: paraview.png
   :align: center
   :width: 80%

   Snapshot of the vertical displacement wavefield propagating through the
   homogeneous halfspace at a given time step. We sliced the cube halfway along
   the X-axis to visualize the wavefield inside the volume.
